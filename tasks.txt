Tasks:

Add live data processing functionality:
    -   Process data live
    -   Return values live

Implement 'change' function:
    -   Look at compression differences and rebound differences and output changes to be made

Fix bit range disparity
    -   Measure length of fork/shock measurement apparatus
    -   Use disparity between fork/sock length and apparatus to fix measured bit range
    -   Add the ability to enter the bikes suspension lengths in the program, not changing constants.

Increase usability
    -   System for creating files? Input key info and the raw accelerometer data file, and it formats it for you (adds header and footer with necessary info)
    -   Include option for metadata describing the run in harder/footer. e.g(Run with suspension fully open or Run pedaling up-hill) This will help us use gathered data easier

Questions for todays meeting:
    -   System for creating files: what does a raw data file look like
    -   What sort of metadata do we want to store
