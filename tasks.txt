Tasks:

Add live data processing functionality:
    -   Process data live
    -   Return values live

Control algorithm:
    -   Begin to explore some potential control algorithms for regression line matching. What sort of issues might we run into?

Fix bit range disparity
    -   Measure length of fork/shock measurement apparatus
    -   Use disparity between fork/sock length and apparatus to fix measured bit range
    -   Add the ability to enter the bikes suspension lengths in the program, not changing constants.

Increase usability
    -   Implement file reading as a pop-up window for easier file loading.
    -   System for creating files? Input key info and the raw accelerometer data file, and it formats it for you (adds header and footer with necessary info)
    -   Include option for metadata describing the run in harder/footer. e.g(Run with suspension fully open or Run pedaling up-hill) This will help us use gathered data easier
